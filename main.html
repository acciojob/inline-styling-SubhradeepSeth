	<p>Flowers are a vital part of the world’s eco-system and are the basis of all life on earth. Not only do they produce oxygen for us to breathe, but they also provide food for birds, insects and animals on every continent. They grow on the highest mountains and even underwater and every country has their own unique varieties.

There are thousands of varieties of flower in the world today and each one has its own history, specific name and place of origin. You can also discover for yourself the different colours in which flowers bloom and what unique scents they produce, if any.

Some of them have inspired poetry, literature, art and music for centuries due to their natural beauty, enticing fragrances and the rainbow of colours they are found in. Here you will find details of all the flowers we have listed, including how to pronounce their names and where they come from.</p>

		<h1 id="f2">Roses pictures</h1>
		<p>Roses have multi-layered petals and smell wonderfully sweet. They come in a wide variety of colors that can convey various meanings: a single red rose, for example, sometimes means, "I love you." Rose is also the past tense of rise, as in “Yesterday, the water rose to the top.” As an adjective, rose means "pink," and when the word is pronounced row-SAY, it means a rose-colored wine. The Latin source of rose is rosa, which probably comes from an Iranian root.</p>
